                        <ol>
                          <li><strong>Player Eligibility:</strong> All players participating in Afterwork.gg competitions, including League of Legends, must have access to a game account in good standing on EU West (EUW) servers.</li>
                          <li><strong>Player Accounts:</strong> Only registered entrants playing under their registered account will be eligible to play. In the event another account is going to be used, the player must make the Afterwork.gg team aware of the change at the earliest opportunity and failure to do so before a scheduled match begins may result in that player being removed from the match.</li>
                          <li><strong>Rulebook Awareness:</strong> Afterwork.gg tournaments operate under the assumption that each entrant is aware of both the general and game-specific rules and checks them regularly, although significant rule changes will be communicated. A lack of knowledge of the rules will not be used as an excuse for rule-breaking.</li>
                          <li><strong>Registration:</strong> The League of Legends registration fee will be £250 per team. This fee will be due after completing registration, payable prior to the tournament start date. Teams with unpaid registration fees at the tournament start date will be ineligible to compete.</li>
                          <li><strong>Teams:</strong> Teams may play the season with 5-10 participants, at least 5 of whom must be named during the pre-tournament registration process. During a match teams select 5 of their players as the active roster. Companies with multiple teams playing may have players float across teams.</li>
                          <li><strong>Game Version:</strong> All players must have their game up to date with the latest patch before their scheduled match times.</li>
                          <li><strong>Connections:</strong> Players are responsible for their own internet connections and avoiding latency-related issues during tournament games.</li>
                          <li><strong>Behaviour:</strong> Players found breaking Afterwork.gg rules or who are found to be ‘hacking’ or manipulating the game beyond standard parameters will be penalised, with the penalty being decided upon by Afterwork.gg staff.</li>
                          <li><strong>Occurrences Outside Official Rules:</strong> Afterwork.gg reserves the right to make statements and decisions about matters that are not specifically provided for in the rules, in order to maintain fair competition and sportsmanship.</li>
                          <li><strong>Rule Changes:</strong> Afterwork.gg reserves the right to change the tournament rules at any time, for example, in response to changes in software updates or game releases.</li>
                          <li><strong>Definitions:</strong>

                              <li><strong>Best-of-X (BOX):</strong> A Match that has X number of Games, and the Team that wins a majority of the Games is declared the winner. Once a Team wins the number of Games needed to reach the requisite majority, then that Team will be declared the winner of the Match, and any Games that have not been played at that point will not be played. For example, in a Best-of-Five Match, once a Team wins 3 Games, that Team will immediately be declared the winner of that Match.</li>
                              <li><strong>Match:</strong> Tournament play between Teams which consist of at least 1 Game.</li> 
                              <li><strong>Game:</strong> A single 5 v 5 game within a Match.</li>

This section will be updated along with an announcement email to all players detailing the final format. There will be a minimum of two stages: a non-elimination round-robin group stage, followed by a single-elimination knockout stage. Game winners will be as shown on the post-game summary screen.

                              <li><strong>Knockout Stage:</strong> Matches will be a best-of-three (BO3) for elimination rounds with teams alternating sides after each game.</li>
                              <li><strong>Finals:</strong> Match will be a best-of-five (BO5) for the grand final with teams alternating sides after each game.</li>

                          </li>
                          <li><strong>Weekly Structure:</strong> The schedule will be communicated to players via the Afterwork.gg Discord in advance of the event day. Matches will be played once per week on Saturdays with the first Game of each Match beginning at 12:00.</li>
                          <li><strong>Structure Changes:</strong> The exact number of Matches and tournament format will be dictated by the number of teams entering and will be communicated to all teams in advance. The organiser reserves the right to add or remove players throughout the tournament and when required change the tournament format accordingly. Under these unlikely circumstances, all players will receive ample communication of the changes from Afterwork.gg.</li>

                              <li>A player experiencing technical issues on either team may call for a restart of the game prior to Game of Record being established:</li>
                              <li>A game of record (“GOR”) refers to a game where all ten players have loaded and which has progressed to a point of meaningful interaction between opposing teams.Prior to this point, if a serious issue has occurred, players should pause the game and contact Afterwork.gg to assess the situation. Once a game attains GOR status, the game will be considered as “official” from that point onward. After the establishment of GOR, game restarts will be allowed only with Afterwork.gg approval.</li>
                              <li>Examples of conditions which establish GOR:
                                <ol type="i">

                                  <li>Setting foot, establishing vision or targeting skillshot ability in an opponent's jungle by either team, which includes either leaving the river or entering brush connected to enemy jungle.</li>

                              <li>The player requesting the restart must be experiencing one of the following: a hardware malfunction (e.g. any equipment malfunction), physical disruption (e.g. breaking furniture), or game configuration problems (e.g. issues with runes, masteries, and/or summoner spells).</li>
                              <li>They must then declare in all-chat for a restart. The game should be paused and Afterwork.gg should be contacted immediately.</li>

                              <li>They must then declare in all-chat the reason for the pause, or the request for a restart. In the event of a restart, the game should be paused and Afterwork.gg should be contacted immediately.</li>
                              <li>Total pause time should not exceed 10 minutes total elapsed time. This can be extended with mutual agreement from both Captains.</li>
