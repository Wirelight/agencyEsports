                          <li>Registration fees support Agency Esports with a portion going towards the charity prize pool. Companies often reimburse or cover the costs registration fees, be sure to request it! The person who completes the team registration form will be marked as the Captain. If the Captain position should change, ping an Agency Esports team member on Discord.</li>
                          <li>Registration fees will be refunded in full if the request is made prior to the close of registration minus any transaction fees incurred from the initial payment. Teams disqualified for any reason will forfeit their registration fees in full and may be excluded from future seasons.</li>
                          <li>All competition will be run through the Agency Esports Discord and registration fees are required before teams will be included in matchups.</li>

                          <li>Players may be added to rosters at any point throughout the season, if the max roster size has not been met. Teams should work with Agency Esports to add players after the season begins. After Week 5, additional players may be added as per individual game rules. Also after Week 5, removing players does not free up additional spots on the roster.</li> 
                          <li>Players must be full time employees at your company and must do work other than playing the game for which you are registered.</li>
                          <li>Players must have an active email address at your company domain. Invalid emails may result in disqualification without a refund. Contact us if this is a concern. Agency Esports will ask for and validate your company email.</li>
                          <li>Interns and contractors/freelancers are allowed provided they pass email verification as above. If their employment term ends during the season, the team must meet the minimum roster size without counting the temporary player.</li>
                          <li>Players which become ineligible during the season must be removed from the team and may no longer play in matches.</li>
                          <li>Players may only play on multiple teams while following the restrictions in Team Eligibility.</li>
                          <li>There is no geographical restriction on players, except that match times are UK/EU-friendly and that games are played on European servers.</li>

                          <li>In general, any player may play on any single team at that player's company, in a single tournament.</li>
                          <li>Within the same company and within the same game's tournament, a player may play on multiple rosters with the following restrictions:
                            <ol type="a"><br>
                              <li>All teams must meet the minimum team size without counting any players who are listed on multiple teams.</li>
                              <li>Shared players still count towards a team’s maximum roster size.</li>
                              <li>A player on multiple rosters may only play for one of those teams of each game in any given week. Violation of this rule will lead to disqualification from Agency Esports.</li>

                          <li>Within the same company, players are typically discouraged from playing on teams across multiple games. Doing so may be allowed at Game Leads' discretion as long as the following criteria are met:
                            <ol type="a"><br>
                              <li>All teams must meet the minimum team size without counting any players who are listed on multiple teams.</li>
                              <li>Teams should understand that relying on a Cross-Game player's availability is not a suitable reason to reschedule a match.</li>
                              <li>A Cross-Game player should not plan to be a primary player on more than 1 team.</li>
                            </ol>
                          </li>

                              <li>There are no more than 2 companies represented on the team, unless this is a team of individual players organised only via contact and approval with Agency Esports.</li>

                          <li>Two Half-Teams may combine and register as a Joint-Team through the normal registration process without first consulting Agency Esports. Please list both companies on the registration form.</li>
                          <li>Half-Teams may also consult Agency Esports for help with pairing, and upon being paired will register as a Joint-Team through the normal registration process.</li>

                          <li>Agency Esports reserves the right to decline a reschedule request should the rescheduled match time prevent transition between tournament stages.</li>

                          <li>If a team partially fails to show up by 15 minutes after the scheduled time, captains should ensure that the situation is documented with screenshots and chat logs.</li>
                          <li>Teams may play without the absent members if the game allows or forfeit the first game round (regardless of Bo1, Bo3, or Bo5). In a multi-round game this will provide the partially-present team an additional 30 minutes for the rest of their team to arrive. If players don't show up within this time, the team may again choose to play with the currently present members or forfeit the rest of the match.</li>
                          <li>In 1v1 games matches default to being played in series (one after another) and in the order of lineup submission. If the missing player is scheduled to play first, they forfeit their game and there will be a 15 minute grace period before the next game round begins​. Two or more forfeits in this way result in an automatic match loss.</li>
                          <li>In the event both teams have arrived to play, but one team fails to join the match lobby within 20 minutes after the scheduled match time the opposing captain may submit documentation (screenshots and chat logs) to claim a victory by forfeit as follows:
                            <ol type="a"><br>
                              <li>In the event of a team game, the opposing captain should provide notice they will be submitting documentation for a victory by forfeit. At this time, the team may still elect to play short-handed.</li>
                              <li>In the event of a 1v1 game, the opposing captain should provide notice to their opponent's captain that they are submitting documentation for a victory by forfeit.</li>

                          </li>
                          <li>Teams may opt to forfeit a match at any time with the consent of their team's members. In this case please notify the organizers and opposing captain in Discord using #reschedule-and-forfeits.</li>
                          <li>Teams which forfeit multiple consecutive weeks and do not respond to messages from the organizers may be removed from the season without a refund.</li>

                              <li>Your Team Captain should then contact Agency Esports and make the case clear to them.</li>
