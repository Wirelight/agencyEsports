                          <li><strong>Player Eligibility:</strong> All players participation in Agency Esports competitions, including FIFA 21, must have access to the game on their registered platform (Xbox or Playstation).</li>
                          <li><strong>Player Accounts:</strong> Only registered entrants playing under their own accounts are eligible to take part.  In the event another account is going to be used, the player must make the Agency Esports team aware of the change at the earliest opportunity and failure to do so before a scheduled match begins will result in an automatic 3-0 forfeit.</li>
                          <li><strong>Rulebook Awareness:</strong> Agency Esports tournaments operate under the assumption that each entrant is aware of both the general and game-specific rules and checks them regularly, although significant rule changes will be communicated. A lack of knowledge of the rules will not be used as an excuse for rule-breaking.</li>
                          <li><strong>Registration:</strong> The FIFA 21 registration fee will be £50 per player. This fee will be due after completing registration, payable prior to the tournament start date. Players with unpaid registration fees at the tournament start date will be ineligible to compete.</li>
                          <li><strong>Game Version:</strong> Entrants must have their game up to date with the latest patch for their system before their scheduled match times.</li>
                          <li><strong>Connections:</strong> Players are responsible for their own internet connections and avoiding latency-related issues during tournament games.</li>
                          <li><strong>Behaviour:</strong> Players found breaking Agency Esports rules or who are found to be ‘hacking’ or manipulating the game beyond standard parameters will be penalised, with the penalty being decided upon by Agency Esports staff.</li>
                          <li><strong>Occurrences Outside Official Rules:</strong> Agency Esports reserves the right to make statements and decisions about matters that are not specifically provided for in the rules, in order to maintain fair competition and sportsmanship.</li>
                          <li><strong>Rule Changes:</strong> Agency Esports reserves the right to change the tournament rules at any time, for example, in response to changes in software updates or game releases.</li>

                          <li><strong>Season Format:</strong> The exact season format will be announced before the season begins when we know the exact number of players. This section will be updated along with an announcement email to all players detailing the final format. There will be a minimum of two stages: a non-elimination round-robin group stage, followed by a single-elimination knockout stage.
                            <ol type="a">
                              <li><strong>Group Stage:</strong> During the round-robin group stage players will play one Match against each other player in their group. 3 points will be awarded per fixture to players for a victory, 1 point for a draw and no points for a defeat.</li> 
                              <li><strong>Positions:</strong> Group positions will be decided by points, then goal difference, then goals scored, then goals against. In the event that 2 players are still equal final positions shall be decided via a single fixture between the 2 players.</li>
                              <li><strong>Knockout Stage:</strong> During the knockout stage players will play one Match against their randomly chosen competitor. Winners will progress onto the next bracket. In the event of a draw, there will be a new match with Golden Goal.  (The first team that scores, wins the match)</li>
                            </ol>
                          </li>
                          <li><strong>Weekly Structure:</strong> The schedule will be communicated to players via the Agency Esports Discord in advance of the event day. Matches will be distributed on Mondays for the coming event day. Kick-off for the first fixture on each event day will begin at 18:00 GMT. Results are due to be reported by players to Agency Esports within 1 hour of completing a Match.</li>
                          <li><strong>Structure Changes:</strong> The organiser reserves the right to add or remove players throughout the tournament and when required change the tournament format accordingly. Under these unlikely circumstances, all players will receive ample communication of the changes from Agency Esports.</li>

The players can try to play the match at a later date by mutual agreement, so long as this is before the next event day. The Business Esports team will make every effort to ensure there is enough time for the replay, however there may be cases (such as the end of the group stage) where a reschedule of play may not be possible or must be completed within a limited timeframe.</li>
                          <li>Should EA game servers go down during a match and all the participants of the tournament are kicked from their games, the fixture in progress will be played again.</li>
                          <li>When the connection is lost mid-game due to technical issues from players equipment, the match will be resumed at the remaining time and the current score.</li>
                          <li>Should a player refuse or be unable to reconnect and complete the fixture following connection loss, their opponent will be awarded an automatic 3-0 win.</li>
                          <li>Should an individual disconnect on purpose mid-game they will receive a warning and their opponent will be awarded an automatic 3-0 win.</li>
                          <li>Should a player disconnect on purpose mid-game on more than one occasion, Agency Esports reserves the rights to immediately disqualify that player from the tournament.</li>
