                        <ol>
                          <li><strong>Player Eligibility:</strong> All players participating in Agency Esports competitions, including CoD: Warzone, must have access to the game on their registered platform (Xbox, PC or Playstation).</li>
                          <li><strong>Player Accounts:</strong> Only registered entrants playing under their own Activision ID accounts are eligible to take part.  In the event another account is going to be used, the player must make the Agency Esports team aware of the change at the earliest opportunity and failure to do so before a scheduled match begins may result in that player being removed from the match.</li>
                          <li><strong>Rulebook Awareness:</strong> Agency Esports tournaments operate under the assumption that each entrant is aware of both the general and game-specific rules and checks them regularly, although significant rule changes will be communicated. A lack of knowledge of the rules will not be used as an excuse for rule-breaking.</li>
                          <li><strong>Registration:</strong> The CoD: Warzone registration fee will be £200 per team. This fee will be due after completing registration, payable prior to the tournament start date. Teams with unpaid registration fees at the tournament start date will be ineligible to compete.</li>
                          <li><strong>Teams:</strong> Teams consist of 3-6 players, all of whom must be named during the pre-tournament registration process. During a match teams select 3 of their players as the active ‘Squad’.</li>
                          <li><strong>Game Version:</strong> All players must have their game up to date with the latest patch for their system before their scheduled match times.</li>
                          <li><strong>Connections:</strong> Players are responsible for their own hardware and internet connections, and avoiding latency-related issues during tournament games.</li>
                          <li><strong>Behaviour:</strong> Players found breaking Agency Esports rules or who are found to be ‘hacking’ or manipulating the game beyond standard parameters will be penalised, with the penalty being decided upon by Agency Esports staff.</li>
                          <li><strong>Occurrences Outside Official Rules:</strong> Agency Esports reserves the right to make statements and decisions about matters that are not specifically provided for in the rules, in order to maintain fair competition and sportsmanship.</li>
                          <li><strong>Rule Changes:</strong> Agency Esports reserves the right to change the tournament rules at any time, for example, in response to changes in software updates or game releases.</li>
